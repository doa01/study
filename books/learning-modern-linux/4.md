## Chapter4. Access Control
### types of access control
- discretionary access control(DAC)
  - based on the identity of user \
    ex) linux filesystem
      - user mike can read/write/execute `/home/script.sh``
  - implementations
    - with owner
    - with capabilities
- mandatory access control(MAC)
  - based on hierarchical model representing security level
  - users assigned to clearance level / resources assigned to security label
  - can access clearance level <= the user's clearance level
  - admin: strictly adn exclusively controls access, 
- linux all-or-nothing attitude.
- either super user with all power or normal user with limited access

### Users
- system user(system account)
  - typically used to run background process
- regular user
- uid convention
  - 0: root(=superuser)
  - 1 \~ 999: reserved for system users
  - 65534: nobody. usecase) mapping remote user to some wellknown id
  - 1000 \~ 65533 , 65536 \~ 4294967294: regular user
```bash
$id -u # uid
```

### managing users locally
- linux provides simple file-based interface with confusing names

  | purpose | file |
  | --- | --- |
  | user database | /etc/passwd | 
  | group database | /etc/group |
  | user passwords | /etc/shadow |
  | group passwords | /etc/gshadow |

- user database
  - user names, uid, group membership, home directory, login shell used, ...
  - etc/passwd
  ```bash
  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
  # user name. <= 32 characters 
  # user password. x means encrypted in /etc/shadow
  # uid
  # gid. see /etc/group
  # user info like full name, phone number. GEOS field
  # user's home directory
  # shell to use. to prevent interactive login, use /sbin/nologin
  ```
  - password are in /etc/shadow, need root privileges
- `adduser` command
  - add user
  - `-r` to create system account
    - disable login shell, and avoid home directory creation
    - see `/etc/adduser.conf`
- group: collection of users

### centralized user management
more than one machine or server
- directory based
  - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP)
    - old
    - defines how to access and maintain a distributed directory over Internet Protocol(IP)
    - can run a LDAP server yourself(ex. KeyCloak), or outsource to cloud provider(ex. Azure Active Directory)

### LDAP
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
- protocol for accessing and maintaining `directory information service` over internet protocol(ip)
- `directory information service`(=directory service)
  - type of a network database that stores information represented as trees of entries
  - ex) dns
- entry
  - 3 components: distinguished name(dn), a collection of attributes, a collection of object classes
  - dn, rdn
    - dn: distinguished name
      - comprised with one or more rdn
      - uniquely identifies the entry in the directory information tree(DIT)
    - rdn: relative distinguished name
      - comprised of attribute-value pairs
      - ex) `uid=john.doe` (single). `givenName=John+sn=Doe`(multiple pairs)
    - null dn = root
    - in dn, rdn is separated by comma, rdn close to root is positioned on the right
      ```
      uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=come
      <-closer to leaf     closer to root->

      ou=people,dc=example,dc=come: parent
      ```
    - attributes
      - data for an entry
      - attribute type, optional attribute options, set of values
      - attribute type: schema element that how attributes should be handled by LDAP client and server
    - object classes
      - schema elements that specify collections of attribute types that may be related to a particular type of object, process or other entity
- operations
  - search, add, modify, modify dn, compare, delete, extended
  - abandon: stop processing the request. client is not interested anymore
  - bind
    - to establish an authorization identity for subsequent operations processed on that connection \
    and to specify LDAP protocol version that the client will use
    - 2 parts: who/what is authenticating, proof of the identity(ex. password, certificate, ...)
    - with simple authentication or SASL authentication
- ref: https://ldap.com/basic-ldap-concepts/

### SASL
- Simple Authentication and Security Layer
- framework for providing authentication and data security services in connection-oriented protocols via replaceable mechanisms
  - ex) used to prove to the server who you are when accessing IMAP server for email
- provides an abstraction layer between protocols and mechanisms
  ```
                  SMTP    LDAP    XMPP   Other protocols ...
                     \       |    |      /
                      \      |    |     /
                     SASL abstraction layer
                      /      |    |     \
                     /       |    |      \
              EXTERNAL   GSSAPI  PLAIN   Other mechanisms ...
  ```
- challenge-response framework
  - server issues a challenge to the client, client sends a response based on the challenge
- does not specify technology for authentication. responsibility of each SASL mechanism(ex. GSASAPI, ...)
- typical process
  - client request authentication
  - server responds a list of supported mechanism
  - client choose one and exchange data
