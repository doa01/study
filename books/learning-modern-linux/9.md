## interprocess communication

### signals

- originally developed as a way for the kernel to notify user space process about a certain event
- asynchronous notification
- can define custom handler

- common signals
  | signal | meaning | default action | handle option | key combination |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | SIGHUP | tell a daemon to reread its config file | terminate process | nohup or custom handler | N/A |
  | SIGINT | user interruption from keyboard | terminate process | custom handler | ctrl + C |
  | SIGQUIT | user quit from keyboard | terminate process | nohup or custom handler | ctrl + \ |
  | SIGKILL | kill process | terminate process | can not be handled | N/A |
  | SIGSTOP | stop process | stop process | can not be handled | N/A |
  | SIGTSTP | user caused stop from keyboard | stop process | custom handler | ctrl + z |
  | SIGTERM | graceful termination | terminate process | custom handler | N/A |
- also signals with undefined meanings exist(SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2)

- registering a signal handler
  ```bash
  # when SIGINT occur, echo hello
  $ trap "echo hello" SIGINT ; while true ; do sleep 1 ; done
  ^Chello
  ```

### named pipes

- named pipes are a wrapper around pipes, using pipefs pseudo filesystem

  ```bash
  $ mkfifo examplepipe

  # file crated
  $ ls -sl exmplapipe

  # write x to named pipe
  # unless some other process reads from pipe, the pipe is blocked
  $ while true ; do echo "x" > examplepipe; sleep 5; done &

  # read from named pipe
  $ while true ; do cat "x" < examplepipe; sleep 5; done &
  ```

### unix domain sockets

- work in single machine.
- bidirectional, multi-way communication endpoints
- kinds
  - stream-oriented(SOCKET_STREAM)
  - datagram-oriented(SOCKET_DGRAM)
  - sequenced-packet(SOCKET_SEQPACKET)

### virtual machines

- components
  - CPI
  - the kernel based virtual machine
  - components in the user space
    - virtual machine monitor(VMM)
      - manages vm and emulates virtual devices
      - ex. QEMU, firecracker, libvirt(a library that exposes a generic API aiming to standarize VMM)
    - the guest kernel
    - the guest process
- kernel-based virtual machine(KVM)
  - linux native virtualization solution for x86 hardware
  - two parts: the core module(kvm.ko), cpu architecture-specific module(kvm-intel.ko.kvm-adm.ko)
  - today hardware usually supports virtualization and kvm is already available
- firecracker
  - vmm that manage kvm instance
  - written in rust
  - developed in AWS, primarily for serverless offerings, such as AWS Lambda ans AWS Fargate
  - designed to safely run multi-tenant workloads on the same physical machine
  - manages so-called microVM that expose an HTTP API to the host, allowing to launch, query and stop the micro VM
  - use seccomp filters to limit the host system calls it cas use. cgroup can be used

## modern linux distros

- prominent traditional linux distributions
  - the red hat family(RHEL, Fedora, CentOS/Rocky)
  - the debian based family(ubuntu, mint, kali, parrot os, elementary os, etc)
  - the SUSE family(openSUSE and Enterprise)
  - Gentoo
  - Arch Linux
- with the rise of containers, the role of host operating system has changed
  - container images package up all the application-level dependencies on top of them
  - every change is a new artifact(image)
  - modern linux -> container-centric
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS
  - dual partition scheme for system updates and the lack of a package manager
- Flatcar Container Linux
- Bottlerocket
  - developed by AWS and meant for hosting container
  - written in rust
- RancherOS
  - everything is a container managed by Docker
  - optimized for container workloads as in their k8s distro.
