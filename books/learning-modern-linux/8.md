# 8. observability

- often reactionary
  - start looking into after something like crash happens
- investigative
  - like checking how long the algorithm took
- predicative
  - get alert on some condition

## Basics

- observability strategy
  - OODA loop: observe-orient-decide-act
- vocabs
  - observability
    - accessing the internal state of a system by measuring external information
  - telemetry
    - the process of extracting signals from sources and transporting the signals to destinations

### signal types

- logs
  - fundamental signal type
  - discrete event with textual payload, meant for human consumption
  - typically with timestamp.
  - ideally structured
  - automating log content is hard due to its textual nature, but still is dominant
- metrics
  - sampled numerical data points, forming a time series
  - usually use aggregation or graphical representation, or used for alerting
  - types
    - counter
      - only go up, besides resetting to zero
    - gauge
      - can go up and down
    - histogram
      - distribution of value
- traces
  - dynamic collection of runtime information
  - not only for debugging bur also for performance assessment

### Logging

- meaning
  - discrete event with textual payload optimized for human consumption
  - discrete event
  - keep the scope of the log message small and specific to find the respective location in the code
  - textual payload
  - default consumers are human
- log comprise of
  - a collection of log items, messages, or lines
  - metadata or context
  - format
- common log formats
  - common event format: developed for archsight; used for devices, and security use cases
  - common log format: for web server
  - graylog extended log format
  - syslog: for operating system
  - embedded metric format: developed by amazon
- cautions
  - avoid overhead wit logs: logrotate
  - do not leak sensitive information
- linux central log directory: `/var/log`

### syslog

- logging standard
- root in networked environment
- has format defined in RFC 5424: header + structured data
  - HEADER
    - PRI: message facility/serverity
    - VER: the syslog protocol number
    - TS: contains the time when the message was generated using ISO 8601 format
    - HN: identifies the machine that sent the message
    - APP: identifies the application or a device that sent the message
    - PID: identifies the process that sent the message
    - MID: optional message id
  - structured data: payload in a key/value-based list
- log management
  - syslogd binary: the most usual one
  - syslog-ng: replacement of syslogd binary. additional supports TLS, content-based filtering, and logging into databases
  - rsyslog: extends the syslog protocol and can be used with systemd

### journalctl

- journalctl uses a binary format -> faster access and better storage footprint
- command
  ```
  # restrict time range
  journcatl --since "2021-09-26 15:40:00" --since "2021-09-26 16:40:00"
  ```
  ```
  # limit the output to specific systemd units
  journcatl -u abc.service
  ```
  ```
  # follow
  journcatl -f
  ```

## monitoring

- types
  - tracking one or more metrics
  - alerting on a condition
- tools
  - uptime: how long a system is running, memory usage, and more
    ```bash
    $ uptime
    20:11:37 up 172 days, 22 min, 4 users, load average: 0.23, 0.54, 0.31
    ```
  - free: memory utilization
    ```bash
    $ free -h
                total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
    Mem:           124G         15G        8.3G        4.7M        101G        109G
    Swap:            0B          0B          0B
    ```
  - vmstat(virtual memory stats)
    ```bash
    $ vmstat
    procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
    r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
    1  0      0 6012852   2120 817048    0    0  2805   289  797  657 21  7 71  1  0
    ```
  - time: measure time spent on operation

### Device I/O and Network Interfaces

### integrated performance monitors

- top: overview in the header, tabular rendering of cpu and memory details, list of process
- htop: incremental top improvement. faster than top and better ui
- atop: also covers resources such as i/o and network stats
- below: quite new. cgroups v2-aware
- others: glances, guider, neoss, mtr

### instrumentation

- instrumentation: emit metrics(signals) from code
  - autoinstrumentation
  - custom instrumentation
- statsD
  - client-side libraries available for many programming languages
  - a few limitations especially in k8s
- in k8s, pull-based or scraping is a better choice
  - scraping: application expose metrics and agent retrieves the metrics

## advanced observability

### tracing and profiling

- tracing
  - the linux kernel: kernel probes, kernel tracepoint
  - user space: application function call
- use case
  - debugging a program: strace
    - strace has overhead. be cautious
  - performance analysis: perf
- profiling
  - identify frequently called code section
